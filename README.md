# Landing-Page-TOP

This was a project established by the Odin Project in order to showcase my Flexbox skills by building a landing page. I drew from my online sleuthing of Nesting Flexbox Containers (quackit.com) and previous Odin Project exercises to set up the layout and build the HTML document from scratch. Unfortunately I forgot to create my repository through GitHub and commit my foundational code due to my excitement to build the page, therefore leaving me to do so halfway through to project and moving all my files to the new repository.

All in all it was a fun project, there were many lessons to be learned, and I enjoyed the continuous process of troubleshooting and editing my code. 

**I decided not to edit using my own designs THIS time because I got distracted in Adobe Illustrator and spent hours making my own logos lol sorry
